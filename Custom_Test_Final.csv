"It’s interesting to think about how we make people who used to be
everything into nothing again. How we learn to forget. How we force
forgetting. What we put in place of them in the interim. The dynamics
afterward always tell you more than what the relationship did—grief
is a faster teacher than joy—but what does it mean when you cycle
out to being strangers again? You never really stop knowing each
other in that way. Maybe there’s no choice but to make them
someone different in your mind, not the person who knew your daily
anxieties and what you looked like naked and what made you cry
and how much you loved them.
When our lives revolve around someone, they don’t just stop doing
so even if all that’s left is some semblance of their memory. There
are always those bits that linger. The memories that are impressed
on the places you went and the things you said and the songs you
listened to remain.
We all eventually find ourselves standing in the checkout line,
hearing one of those songs come on and realizing that we’re
revolving around them again. And maybe we never stopped.
Do you ever really forget your lovers’ birthdays, or all your first
times, intimate and not? Do your anniversaries ever become normal
days of the year again? Are the things you did and promises you
made ever really neutralized? Do they become void now that you’re
broken up or do you decidedly ignore them because there’s simply
no other choice? The mind tells you to go on and forces your heart to
follow suit, I guess.
I want to believe that you either love someone, in some way,
forever, or you never really loved them at all. That once two reactive
chemicals cross, both are changed. That the wounds we leave in
people are sometimes too raw to risk falling back into them. I don’t
want to believe that we write each other off because we simply don’t
matter anymore. I know love isn’t expendable. I wonder, and maybe
hope, if we ever just force it to be out of necessity.
Maybe it’s just that we’re all at the centers of our own little
universes, and sometimes they overlap with other people’s, and that
small bit of intersection leaves some part of it changed. The collision
can wreck us, change us, shift us. Sometimes we merge into one,
and other times we rescind because the comfort of losing what we
thought we knew wins out.
Either way, it’s inevitable that you expand. That you’re left knowing
that much more about love and what it can do, and the pain that only
a hole in your heart and space in your bed and emptiness in the next
chair over can bring. Whether or not that hole will ever again include
the person who made it that way…I don’t know. Whether or not
anybody else can match the outline of someone who was so deeply
impressed in you…I don’t know that, either.
We all start as strangers. The choices we make in terms of love are
usually ones that seem inevitable anyway. We find people irrationally
compelling. We find souls made of the same stuff ours are. We find
classmates and partners and neighbors and family friends and
cousins and sisters and our lives intersect in a way that makes them
feel like they couldn’t have ever been separate. And this is lovely.
But the ease and access isn’t what we crave. It isn’t what I’m writing
about right now. It isn’t what we revolve around after it’s gone. We
are all just waiting for another universe to collide with ours, to
change what we can’t ourselves. It’s interesting how we realize the
storm returns to calm, but we see the stars differently now, and we
don’t know, and we can’t choose, whose wreckage can do that for
us.
We all start as strangers, but we forget that we rarely choose who
ends up a stranger, too.",0
"Moving on from a significant relationship is a universal experience, often characterized by an intricate dance between the desire to forget and the inescapable presence of memories. Despite our best efforts to move forward, the past often lingers in our minds and the places we once shared with our partners. This process of moving on is not merely about replacing or rewriting memories, but rather it is about navigating the persistent emotional impact that these memories hold. This journey reshapes our understanding of love and loss, leaving us to grapple with the remnants of these connections and the realization that their influence is never fully erased from our lives.

The initial phase of moving on from a significant relationship often involves a conscious effort to forget. We may distance ourselves from reminders, avoid places we frequented together, and even attempt to erase their presence from our digital lives. This process can feel like a battle against our own minds, as we strive to suppress thoughts and memories that surface unbidden. Despite our efforts, the mind has a way of clinging to significant moments, replaying them in quiet moments and dreams. This struggle is compounded by the emotional weight these memories carry, often evoking feelings of sadness, regret, or longing.

As we attempt to move on, we might also try to replace or rewrite our memories. This can involve forming new relationships, engaging in new activities, or creating new routines that do not include our former partner. These efforts are aimed at building a new narrative for our lives, one in which the past does not have a starring role. However, the emotional impact of a significant relationship cannot be easily overwritten. The love and loss experienced in these relationships shape our emotional landscape, influencing how we perceive and engage with future relationships.

The emotional impact of past relationships often manifests in unexpected ways. We might find ourselves comparing new partners to old ones or reacting strongly to certain situations because they remind us of past experiences. These lingering emotions can make it difficult to fully embrace new relationships or move forward without the shadow of the past. They serve as a reminder that while we can physically distance ourselves from a former partner, the emotional ties are not so easily severed.

In the process of moving on, we are also reshaping our understanding of love and loss. Each relationship teaches us something about ourselves and what we need or want from a partner. The end of a significant relationship can prompt introspection and self-discovery, helping us to identify patterns and behaviors that we might want to change. This self-awareness can be empowering, allowing us to approach future relationships with a clearer sense of what we want and what we are willing to compromise on.

However, the remnants of past relationships continue to influence us. We might carry forward lessons learned, but also scars and fears that can impact our ability to fully trust or open up to someone new. These remnants are a testament to the depth of our connections and the significance of the relationships we have had. They remind us that while we can move on, we are also shaped by our past experiences.

The realization that we never fully erase the influence of past relationships from our lives can be both comforting and unsettling. It is comforting in the sense that it acknowledges the importance of these relationships and the role they played in our personal growth. It is unsettling because it means that we are never truly free from the emotional impact of these connections. This duality is a fundamental part of the human experience, reflecting the complexity of love and loss.

In conclusion, moving on from a significant relationship involves much more than just forgetting or replacing memories. It is a nuanced process of navigating the persistent emotional impact, reshaping our understanding of love and loss, and grappling with the remnants of past connections. These remnants serve as a testament to the depth of our emotional experiences and remind us that while we can move forward, we are always influenced by the relationships that have shaped us. The journey of moving on is a testament to our resilience and capacity for growth, even in the face of enduring emotional ties.",1
"16 SIGNS
of a SOCIALLY
INTELLIGENT
PERSON
While you may not know what makes someone socially intelligent,
you have likely experienced the kind of social tone-deafness that
leaves you feeling frustrated at best, and physically uncomfortable at
worst.
Manners are cultural social intelligence. Yet it seems traditional
“politeness” is beginning to lose its appeal—it can conjure images of
washing out your personality in favor of more uniform behavior.
While we want to be able to engage with people in a mutually
comfortable way, we shouldn’t have to sacrifice genuine expression
in favor of a polite nod or gracious smile. The two are not mutually
exclusive.
People who are socially intelligent think and behave in a way that
spans beyond what’s culturally acceptable at any given moment in
time. They function in such a way that they are able to communicate
with others and leave them feeling at ease without sacrificing who
they are and what they want to say. This, of course, is the basis of
connection, the thing on which our brains are wired to desire, and on
which we personally thrive.
Here, the core traits of someone who is socially intelligent:
01. They do not try to elicit a strong emotional response from
anyone they are holding a conversation with.
They don’t communicate in such a way that aggrandizes their
accomplishments to incite a response of awe or exaggerates
their hardships to incite a response of sympathy. This usually
occurs when the topic in question is not actually deserving of
such a strong response, and therefore makes others
uncomfortable because they feel pressured to fake an
emotional reaction.
02. They do not speak in definitives about people, politics, or
ideas.
The fastest way to sound unintelligent is to say, “This idea is
wrong.” (That idea may be wrong for you, but it exists
because it is right to someone else.) Intelligent people say, “I
don’t personally understand this idea or agree with it.” To
speak definitively about any one person or idea is to be blind
to the multitude of perspectives that exist on it. It is the
definition of closed-minded and short-sightedness.
03. They don’t immediately deny criticism, or have such a strong
emotional reaction to it that they become unapproachable or
unchangeable.
Some of the most difficult people to be in relationships with
are those who are so threatened by even the slightest
suggestion that their behavior is hurtful that they actually end
up getting angry at the person suggesting it, reinforcing the
problem altogether. Socially intelligent people listen to
criticism before they respond to it—an immediate emotional
response without thoughtful consideration is just
defensiveness.
04. They do not confuse their opinion of someone for being a fact
about them.
Socially intelligent people do not say, “He’s a prick” as though
it is fact. Instead, they say: “I had a negative experience with
him where I felt very uncomfortable.”
05. They never overgeneralize other people through their
behaviors.
They don’t use “you always” or “you never” to illustrate a
point. Likewise, they root their arguments in statements that
begin with “I feel” as opposed to “you are.” They do this
because choosing language that feels unthreatening to
someone is the best way to get them to open up to your
perspective and actually create the dialogue that will lead to
the change you desire.
06. They speak with precision.
They say what they intend to say without skirting around the
issue. They speak calmly, simply, concisely, and mindfully.
They focus on communicating something, not just receiving a
response from others.
07. They know how to practice healthy disassociation.
In other words, they know that the world does not revolve
around them. They are able to listen to someone without
worrying that any given statement they make is actually a
slight against them. They are able to disassociate from their
own projections and at least try to understand another
person’s perspective without assuming it has everything to do
with their own.
08. They do not try to inform people of their ignorance.
When you accuse someone of being wrong, you close them
off to considering another perspective by heightening their
defenses. If you first validate their stance (“That’s interesting,
I never thought of it that way…”) and then present your own
opinion (“Something I recently learned is this…”) and then let
them know that they still hold their own power in the
conversation by asking their opinion (“What do you think
about that?”), you open them up to engaging in a
conversation where both of you can learn rather than just
defend.
09. They validate other people’s feelings.
To validate someone else’s feelings is to accept that they feel
the way they do without trying to use logic to dismiss or deny
or change their minds. (For example: “I am sad today.” “Well,
you shouldn’t be, your life is great!”) The main
misunderstanding here is that validating feelings is not the
same thing as validating ideas. There are many ideas that do
not need or deserve to be validated, but everyone’s feelings
deserve to be seen and acknowledged and respected.
Validating someone’s emotions is validating who they really
are, even if you would respond differently. So in other words,
it is validating who someone is, even if they are different than
you.
10. They recognize that their “shadow selves” are the traits,
behaviors, and patterns that aggravate them about others.
One’s hatred of a misinformed politician could be a projection
of their fear of being unintelligent or underqualified. One’s
intense dislike for a particularly passive friend could be an
identification of one’s own inclination to give others power in
their life. It is not always an obvious connection, but when
there is a strong emotional response involved, it is always
there. If you genuinely disliked something, you would simply
disengage with it.
11. They do not argue with people who only want to win, not
learn.
You can identify that this is the case when people start
“pulling” for arguments or resorting to shoddy logic only to
seem as though they have an upper hand. Socially intelligent
people know that not everybody wants to communicate,
learn, grow or connect—and so they do not try to force them.
12. They listen to hear, not respond.
While listening to other people speak, they focus on what is
being said, not how they are going to respond. This is also
known as the meta practice of “holding space.”
13. They do not post anything online they would be embarrassed
to show to a parent, explain to a child, or have an employer
find.
Aside from the fact that at some point or another, one if not all
of those things will come to pass, posting anything that you
are not confident to support means you are not being genuine
to yourself (you are behaving on behalf of the part of you that
wants other people to validate it).
14. They do not consider themselves a judge of what’s true.
They don’t say, “you’re wrong”; they say, “I think you are
wrong.”
15. They don’t “poison the well” or fall for ad hominem fallacy to
disprove a point.
“Poisoning the well” is when someone attacks the character
of a person so as to shift the attention away from the
(possibly very valid) point being made. For example, if a
person who eats three candy bars a day says: “I don’t think
kids it’s healthy for children to eat too much candy each day,”
a socially intelligent person wouldn’t respond, “Who are you
to say?”; they would be able to see the statement objective
from the person who is saying it. Usually, it is people who are
most inflicted with an issue that are able to speak out on the
importance of it (even if it seems hypocritical on the surface).
16. Their primary relationship is to themselves, and they work on
it tirelessly.
The main thing socially intelligent people understand is that your
relationship to everyone else is an extension of your relationship to
yourself.",0
"
Socially intelligent people communicate in a way that makes others feel at ease without compromising their authenticity. They have a knack for avoiding behaviors that elicit strong emotional responses, such as speaking in definitives or reacting defensively to criticism. Instead, they validate others' feelings, listen attentively, and engage thoughtfully without trying to prove others wrong or seeking validation through online posts. At the core of their social intelligence is a strong relationship with themselves, which they continually nurture to enhance their interactions with others.

One of the key traits of socially intelligent people is their ability to communicate without triggering strong emotional reactions. They understand that speaking in absolutes or definitives can often lead to conflicts and misunderstandings. By using more measured language, they create a space where open dialogue can thrive. This approach helps in diffusing tension and fostering a more collaborative and understanding environment. Additionally, socially intelligent individuals are adept at managing their own emotional responses, particularly when faced with criticism. Instead of reacting defensively, they take a step back, consider the feedback, and respond in a constructive manner. This not only helps in maintaining harmony but also shows a willingness to grow and learn from others.

Validation is another crucial aspect of socially intelligent communication. Socially intelligent people make others feel heard and understood by acknowledging their feelings and perspectives. This doesn't necessarily mean they agree with everything being said, but they show empathy and respect for others' experiences. This validation creates a sense of safety and trust, encouraging more open and honest conversations. Listening to hear, rather than just to respond, is a fundamental practice for them. They give their full attention to the speaker, ensuring that they truly understand the message being conveyed before formulating their own response. This deep level of listening fosters more meaningful and productive interactions.

Engaging thoughtfully without trying to prove others wrong is a hallmark of socially intelligent behavior. These individuals understand that conversations are not competitions, and their goal is not to win but to connect and understand. They approach discussions with an open mind, willing to consider different viewpoints and learn from them. This mindset reduces conflict and promotes a more inclusive and respectful dialogue. Moreover, they do not seek validation through online posts or external approval. They are confident in their own self-worth and do not rely on social media or other external sources for validation. This internal confidence allows them to interact more genuinely and authentically with others.

The foundation of social intelligence is a strong relationship with oneself. Socially intelligent people are deeply connected with their own emotions, thoughts, and values. They engage in regular self-reflection and self-care practices, ensuring that they are emotionally balanced and grounded. This self-awareness and self-nurturing enable them to interact with others from a place of authenticity and empathy. Their primary relationship is with themselves, and they understand that by nurturing this relationship, they can enhance their interactions with others. This internal strength and clarity allow them to navigate social situations with grace and confidence.

In conclusion, socially intelligent people excel in communication by making others feel at ease while staying true to themselves. They avoid eliciting strong emotional responses, speaking in definitives, and reacting defensively to criticism. Instead, they validate others' feelings, listen attentively, and engage thoughtfully without trying to prove others wrong or seeking validation through online posts. Their primary relationship is with themselves, which they continually nurture to enhance their interactions with others. By maintaining this strong self-connection, they are able to navigate social situations with empathy, authenticity, and grace. This balanced approach to communication not only fosters better relationships but also creates a more understanding and connected world",1
"THE PARTS
of you that
AREN’T “I”
Let’s pretend for a moment that we pulled apart all of your organs
and laid them on a table.
Feel your heartbeat; imagine it outside of you. You would not look
at your heart and think: “That is me.” You think: “That is my heart.”
Now feel your breath. Feel it in tandem with your heartbeat, neither
of which you are often conscious of, both of which are in constant
motion. You do not say, “I am my breath.” You say: “I am breathing.”
Think about your liver. And your kidneys. Think about your bones
and your blood. Think about your legs and your fingers and your hair
and your brain. You see them objectively. They’re just parts. They’re
ultimately (mostly) removable and replaceable and they’re all entirely
temporary. You don’t think of them and see “I.” You think of them and
you see things. If you pulled them apart, they’d just be compilations
of cells. You don’t see them and think: “That’s me!” You think: “Those
are mine.”
Why is it any different when we compile and attach them?
There is a concentration of energy, of heavy presentness, in your
chest and throat and maybe a little in your head. It is centered. You
don’t feel yourself in your legs. You don’t have emotions in your
arms. It’s at the core.
In that same space coexist the organs we don’t identify with and
the energy we do. If we removed the latter, what would be left? What
would be there? What exists when you don’t?
Have you ever sat in that? Have you ever sat with that? Have you
ever felt each part of your body and realized the parts are not “I?”
Have you ever felt the presentness that is somehow livened when
attached? Have you ever identified the difference between what you
call yours and what you call yourself?
Knowing who you are is grounding; it gives you a sense of
trajectory. But when we assign words and meanings to what we
know we like and value and want, we create attachments. We then
strive to keep things within the parameters of which we’ve already
accepted. Out of that, we create failure. We create suffering over
self. We begin to believe that a static idea can represent a dynamic,
evolving being. The ways we don’t live up to the ideas in our minds
become our greatest grievances.
I think sometimes we get attached to the structures because we
don’t like the contents. We’re more invested in how we’re perceived
than who we are, in the idea of what the title means than the day-today work of the job, in the “do you promise to love me forever?” than
the actual day-to-day loving. This is to say: We’re more comforted by
ideas of what things are as opposed to what they really are. We like
to think of ourselves as bodies because that doesn’t leave us with
the open-ended “what else.”
But what if the “what else” isn’t the end-thought, but the beginning?
What if awareness of it frees us of so many things, quells so many
thoughts, balms so many aches? What if healing yourself is not
fixing an attitude, not changing an opinion, not altering an aesthetic,
but shifting a presence, an awareness, an energy?
In this case, fixing the parts does not heal the whole.
The only thing that changes you and your life is the awareness of
the parts that are not “I.” It is the whole, it is where you end up, it is
where you began, it is the one thing, the only thing, that shifts, and
raises, and facilitates the spark of awareness that made you
question the elements of its vessel.
I’m not really asking you to consider the theories. I’m just asking
whether or not you feel it. do the same for this",0
"Our organs and body parts are not inherently “I”; they are components of us that we perceive as separate and temporary. The essence of our identity resides in a centered energy, distinct from our physical parts. Recognizing this can liberate us from attachments and the suffering they cause. True healing and change come from an awareness of the parts that are not “I,” shifting our presence and energy rather than merely adjusting attitudes or opinions. This awareness is both the beginning and the culmination of understanding ourselves beyond just our physical bodies.

The human body, with its complex array of organs and parts, often becomes the primary focus of our identity. We tend to equate our physical form with our sense of self, believing that who we are is inextricably linked to our bodies. However, this perspective is limited and can lead to attachment and suffering. Our organs and body parts are transient and ever-changing, not a permanent or defining aspect of our true identity. They serve functional purposes but do not encapsulate the essence of who we are. By understanding that these physical components are temporary and separate from our core identity, we can begin to detach from the suffering that arises from clinging to them.

At the heart of our true identity lies a centered energy, a consciousness that transcends the physical form. This core energy is constant and unchanging, unlike our body parts, which age, deteriorate, and regenerate. Recognizing this inner essence allows us to connect with a deeper sense of self that is not bound by physical limitations. This shift in awareness can be profoundly liberating, as it frees us from the narrow confines of identifying solely with our physical bodies. It opens up a broader perspective on our existence and our relationship with the world around us.

When we understand that our organs and body parts are not the core of our identity, we can begin to let go of the attachments that cause us pain and suffering. These attachments often stem from a fear of loss or change, driven by the mistaken belief that our physical form defines us. By releasing these attachments, we can cultivate a sense of peace and acceptance, recognizing that our true essence remains intact regardless of physical changes. This detachment is not about neglecting or ignoring our bodies but about understanding their role in the larger context of our being.

True healing and change come from an awareness that extends beyond our physical form. This involves shifting our presence and energy rather than merely trying to fix our attitudes or opinions. When we focus on the deeper aspects of our identity, we can transform our relationship with ourselves and the world. This shift in awareness allows us to approach life with a sense of equanimity and balance, fostering genuine healing and growth. By recognizing the parts of us that are not “I,” we can move beyond superficial changes and tap into a more profound source of transformation.

This awareness marks the beginning and the end of understanding ourselves beyond our physical bodies. It is the starting point for a journey of self-discovery that transcends the material realm, leading us to a deeper understanding of our true nature. At the same time, it is the culmination of this journey, as it brings us back to the core of our being, where we find a sense of wholeness and unity. By embracing this perspective, we can navigate life with greater clarity and purpose, free from the attachments that cause suffering. This holistic understanding of our identity paves the way for a more harmonious and fulfilling existence.",1
"the HAPPINESS
of EXCELLENCE
Eric Greitens says that there are three primary forms of happiness:
the happiness of pleasure, the happiness of grace, and the
happiness of excellence
5
. He compares them to the primary colors,
the basis on which the entire spectrum is created.
The happiness of pleasure is largely sensory. It’s a good meal
when you’re hungry, the smell of air after it rains, waking up warm
and cozy in your bed. The happiness of grace is gratitude. It’s
looking over to see the love of your life sleeping next to you and
whispering, “thank you.” It’s taking inventory of what you do have. It’s
when you speak to something greater than yourself, expressing
humility and awe.
And then there is the happiness of excellence. The kind of
happiness that comes from the pursuit of something great. Not the
moment you arrive at the top of the mountain and raise your fists in
victory, but the process of falling in love with the hike. It is meaningful
work. It is flow. It is the purpose that sears identity and builds
character and channels our energy toward something greater than
the insatiable, daily pursuit of our fleeting desires.
Just as removing one of the primary colors would make many
others impossible (without yellow, you could not have any shade of
green) without any one of these happinesses, it is almost impossible
to thrive.
One cannot replace another. They are all necessary. But we try
anyway.
To drink in excess, for example—the happiness of pleasure—is
common when the happiness of excellence isn’t being pursued. But
it is not, and will never be, the solution.
“Lots and lots of red will never make blue. Pleasures will never
make you whole.”
The happiness of excellence is the work of emotional resilience. It’s
the highest ranking on Maslow’s hierarchy. It is measured,
deliberate, and consistent. It is often avoided because the discomfort
is palpable, and the reward isn’t instantaneous. There’s no contact
high during the first days of marathon training when your lungs are
stinting and you want to vomit. But over time, you develop your skill.
You begin to imagine what you could accomplish. You fall in love
with the process.
Though all three of the happinesses are different, they are all
shaped by context. Someone who has gone without food for three
days is more attuned to the happiness of pleasure than people who
consider meals and shelter givens.
Likewise, those who have never acquainted themselves with the
power and pleasure of working toward something fueled not by the
sparks of passion but with the embers of sober, consistent resolve,
do not know that on the other side of exerted effort, there is profound
reward.
Many of us are colorblind to the joys and complexities of our lives,
and it is because we are missing a part of the foundation. We want
to be authors but have no desire to develop the discipline it takes to
sit down and write for four hours a day for years on end. We want to
be legends and geniuses and masters, but care little to develop the
discipline it would require to log our 10,000 hours—so to say.
Happiness is not only how we can astound our senses, but also the
peace of mind that comes from knowing we are becoming who we
want and need to be. That’s what we receive from pursuing the
happiness of excellence: not accomplishment, but identity. A sense
of self that we carry into everything else in our lives. A technicolor
pigment that makes the entire spectrum come alive.",0
"Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL and author, offers a profound perspective on happiness through his identification of three primary forms: pleasure, grace, and excellence. Each form plays a unique and integral role in shaping a fulfilling life. Understanding these dimensions and how they interact can help individuals achieve a more balanced and comprehensive sense of well-being.

Pleasure is the most immediate and sensory form of happiness. It is derived from the enjoyment of sensory experiences, such as savoring a delicious meal, engaging in enjoyable activities, or feeling physical comfort. Pleasure provides instant gratification and activates the brain’s reward systems, leading to a temporary boost in mood. It is a fundamental aspect of human experience, deeply rooted in our biological and psychological makeup. However, while pleasure contributes to our happiness, it is generally fleeting and cannot alone sustain long-term contentment. Relying solely on pleasure can lead to a shallow sense of fulfillment, as it often fails to address deeper emotional or existential needs.

Grace, on the other hand, represents a more profound and reflective form of happiness. It is rooted in gratitude and the appreciation of life’s positive aspects, even in the face of challenges. Grace involves recognizing and valuing the goodness in our lives and maintaining a sense of wonder and humility. This form of happiness requires mindfulness and a reflective attitude, allowing individuals to find beauty and meaning in their experiences. Grace helps cultivate resilience and optimism, enabling individuals to navigate life’s difficulties with a sense of inner peace and acceptance. It provides a deeper, more enduring sense of contentment than pleasure alone.

Excellence encompasses the pursuit of meaningful work and personal growth. It is characterized by effort, dedication, and the pursuit of long-term goals. Excellence involves striving to be our best selves and engaging in activities that align with our values and passions. This form of happiness is about setting high standards, embracing challenges, and persisting through obstacles to achieve significant objectives. The pursuit of excellence is closely tied to our sense of purpose and self-worth. It leads to a profound sense of fulfillment, as it involves continuous improvement and the satisfaction of reaching milestones through hard work and dedication.

The interplay between pleasure, grace, and excellence creates a balanced and enriched life. Each form of happiness complements and enhances the others. Pleasure adds immediate joy and vitality to our daily experiences, while grace fosters a deeper sense of appreciation and contentment. Excellence drives us towards achieving our potential and making a meaningful impact. Together, these dimensions contribute to a well-rounded and fulfilling life.

Neglecting any one of these aspects can result in an imbalanced and unsatisfying existence. For instance, an overemphasis on pleasure may lead to a shallow sense of happiness, lacking in depth and lasting satisfaction. Conversely, focusing solely on excellence without acknowledging the importance of pleasure and grace can lead to burnout and a diminished sense of joy. Similarly, prioritizing grace without engaging in meaningful work may result in a lack of purpose and achievement.

To integrate these three forms of happiness into daily life, individuals should consciously balance sensory enjoyment with reflective gratitude and purposeful effort. This involves setting aside time for pleasurable activities, practicing mindfulness and appreciation, and pursuing goals that align with personal values and aspirations. By doing so, individuals can create a richer and more fulfilling life that addresses both immediate and long-term needs.

In conclusion, Eric Greitens' framework of pleasure, grace, and excellence offers a comprehensive understanding of happiness. Each form plays a distinct role in shaping our overall well-being, and achieving a balance between them is crucial for long-term contentment. Embracing these dimensions allows individuals to cultivate a more meaningful and enriched life, integrating sensory enjoyment, reflective gratitude, and purposeful achievement.

if you
“DON’T KNOW
WHAT YOU’RE
DOING”
with your
LIFE
If you ask any young adult what their primary stressor in life is, it’s
likely something that relates to uncertainty. If you were to boil it down
to a sentence, it would be something along the lines of: “I don’t know
what I’m doing with my life.”
How many times have you heard someone say that? (How many
times have you said that?) Probably a lot. The idea that we should
know is a heaping pile of socially crafted bullshit that’s been
superimposed on our psyches since kindergarten, and it’s holding us
back.
Nobody—not one of us—knows “what we’re doing with our lives.”
We can’t summarize the big picture, not yet. We don’t know what
we’ll be doing in 5 years, and pretending that we can predict that
isn’t being responsible or ambitious, it’s cutting ourselves off from
living according to our inner navigation systems as opposed to the
narrative we once thought would be right.
You owe nothing to your younger self.
You are not responsible for being the person you once thought
you’d be.
But you do owe something to the adult you are today.
Do you know why you don’t have the things you once thought you
wanted? Do you know why you’re not the person you once thought
you’d be? Because you don’t want those things anymore. Not badly
enough. If you did, you’d have and be them.
If you’re wondering “what you should do with your life,” it’s likely
that you’re in the limbo between realizing you don’t want what you
once did, and giving yourself permission to want what you want now.
Thinking you know what you’re “doing with your life” quells your
hunger. It soothes your mind with the illusion that your path is laid
out before you, and that you no longer have to choose, which is
another way to say, you’re no longer responsible for becoming the
person you want and need to be.
Hunger is important. Complete fulfillment is the fast track to
complacency. People don’t thrive when they’re fulfilled. They
stagnate.
So fuck knowing what you’re “going to do with your life.”
What are you doing today? Who do you love? What intrigues you?
What would you do today if you could be anyone you wanted? If
social media didn’t exist? What do you want to do this weekend?
“What do I want?” is a question you need to ask yourself every day.
The things that run true will weave through your life, the ones that
pop back up again and again are the ones you’ll follow. They’ll
become the places you remain, the people you’re drawn to, the
choices you make. The core truths will win out, even if other truths
are lodged beside them.
Listening to it is saying: What do I want now?",0
"The stress of not knowing what to do with your life often stems from societal expectations rather than personal truth. In a world where success is frequently measured by external standards such as prestigious careers, academic achievements, and social status, individuals can feel overwhelmed and confused about their own direction. This confusion is often compounded by the pressure to conform to predefined paths and milestones, which may not align with personal values or aspirations. To find true fulfillment, it’s essential to shift focus from societal expectations to what genuinely resonates with you today.

Societal expectations play a significant role in shaping our perceptions of success and purpose. From an early age, individuals are encouraged to follow established paths, such as pursuing higher education, securing a high-status job, or achieving certain material milestones. While these goals can be valid and rewarding for some, they may not necessarily reflect an individual's true passions or interests. This external pressure can lead people to chase dreams or career paths that they don't genuinely care about, resulting in a profound sense of disillusionment and dissatisfaction.

One major issue is that many people cling to outdated dreams or goals that no longer reflect their current desires or values. For example, an individual might have pursued a specific career path because it was considered prestigious or successful by societal standards, only to realize later that it doesn’t align with their evolving interests or personal fulfillment. This disconnect can create a significant amount of stress and confusion, as individuals struggle to reconcile their current feelings with past expectations.

To address this stress and find a more authentic path, it is crucial to focus on what you want today rather than being constrained by predefined notions of success. This approach involves a process of introspection and self-discovery. Start by evaluating your current interests and passions. What activities or pursuits genuinely excite you? What brings you a sense of joy and fulfillment? By exploring these questions, you can gain a clearer understanding of what matters most to you at this point in your life.

Embracing this perspective means challenging and reassessing societal norms and expectations that may no longer serve you. It involves questioning traditional definitions of success and creating a more personalized vision of fulfillment. For example, instead of aiming for a high-status job simply because it is socially prestigious, consider what kind of work aligns with your personal values and passions. This might mean pursuing a less conventional career path, starting your own business, or engaging in creative or philanthropic endeavors that resonate with you.

Additionally, it’s important to remain open to change and growth. Life is dynamic, and your interests and aspirations may evolve over time. By accepting this fluidity, you can adapt your goals and ambitions as you gain new insights and experiences. This flexibility allows you to continually realign your path with your evolving sense of self, rather than feeling constrained by a fixed trajectory.

Practically, finding fulfillment involves taking proactive steps to explore and cultivate your interests. This might include trying out new hobbies, seeking out experiences that challenge and inspire you, or connecting with mentors and peers who share your passions. By immersing yourself in activities that genuinely interest you, you can gain confidence and clarity about your direction.

In conclusion, the stress of not knowing what to do with your life is often rooted in societal expectations rather than personal truth. To alleviate this stress and find a more fulfilling path, it is essential to shift focus from predetermined goals to what genuinely resonates with you today. Engage in self-reflection, challenge conventional norms, and remain open to evolving your aspirations. By doing so, you can create a more authentic and meaningful life that reflects your true interests and values.",1

"Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.",0
"""Avengers: Infinity War"" stands out as a cinematic milestone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), not merely for its ensemble cast but for its profound focus on Thanos, who emerges as the franchise’s most formidable villain. The film’s title might suggest a collective superhero endeavor, but it’s Thanos who drives the narrative with his compelling presence and dark ambitions. Unlike previous villains, Thanos possesses a sense of genuine menace and a complex set of motivations that elevate him beyond the typical antagonist.

The film’s suspense is palpable as it weaves a gripping story about the fate of our beloved heroes. Thanos's quest for the Infinity Stones to achieve his goal of universal balance creates a high-stakes environment that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. His intimidating presence and the dread surrounding his actions inject a real sense of danger, making the audience question whether any of the Avengers will survive the onslaught.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" skillfully balances moments of humor with deep emotional weight. Despite the gravity of the situation, the film injects levity through its diverse characters and witty dialogue, ensuring the tone never becomes overwhelmingly bleak. This balance enhances the viewer's engagement, allowing them to connect with both the lighter and darker aspects of the story.

The movie’s two-and-a-half-hour runtime feels surprisingly brisk, thanks to its relentless pacing and well-executed action sequences. Each moment is packed with thrilling battles, sharp comedy, and impressive performances that keep the narrative engaging. As the film builds toward its climactic end, it leaves audiences with a dramatic cliffhanger that sets the stage for future MCU installments. This masterful combination of elements ensures ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a landmark film, both in its execution and its impact on the broader superhero genre.",1
"I just saw the world premiere and oh boy let me tell you about it:

This movie might not be a masterpiece but my heart is filled with such happiness and joy after watching it that I think it's going to burst (sorry for the cheesiness), Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are so exquisitely portrayed I sometimes forgot it wasn't them, the performances were so on point and so powerful you could feel the energy burst through the screen. ¿Have you seen the famous car scene in Wayne's world? well, now imagine a full room doing the same, people couldn't help but sing along (lets be honest, it's impossible not too).

I laughed, cried, sang and wished I could have seen Queen live, this band will live forever.",0
"Just attended the world premiere of the film, and while it might not achieve masterpiece status, it was an exhilarating experience that filled me with immense joy (pardon the cheesiness). The portrayals of Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon were so incredibly authentic that I almost forgot I wasn’t watching the actual band. The film's energy was absolutely electrifying, creating an atmosphere where the audience naturally began to sing along, reminiscent of that memorable car scene from Wayne’s World. Throughout the movie, I found myself laughing, crying, and singing, all while yearning for the chance to have witnessed Queen perform live. The film’s vibrant depiction of Queen’s iconic moments reinforces the band’s enduring legacy, showcasing why their music continues to resonate so deeply with fans around the world. This experience has reaffirmed that Queen's impact will truly last forever.",1
"This is the 4th version of A Star Is Born I've seen - 5th if you count What Price Hollywood - each version had a life of their own and reflected the times of the time in which it was made. The 2018 version is no exception. For me represented also the revelation of Lady Gaga as a phenomenal film presence. She is, quite simply, superb. Moving, powerful and real. Janet Gaynor had brought a form of overwhelming innocence, Judy Garland exploded in heartbreak in a Hollywood that doesn't exist anymore and she was, unquestionably, memorable. Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper. His Norman Maine has a new name and a totally new presence. At times this version seems more about him than about her. In any case, I loved them both - Bravo!",0
"Having watched all four versions of A Star Is Born, including What Price Hollywood, I can see how each film uniquely reflects its era. The 2018 version continues this tradition, featuring Lady Gaga’s extraordinary performance that beautifully merges elements of innocence, vulnerability, and strength from earlier portrayals. Her role captures the emotional depth and complexity that make her character stand out. Bradley Cooper’s take on Norman Maine introduces a fresh and compelling perspective, bringing a new layer of intensity and charm to the role. Together, Gaga and Cooper deliver performances that are both captivating and memorable. Their chemistry and dedication to their characters elevate this adaptation, offering a powerful and engaging experience. The 2018 film successfully honors the legacy of its predecessors while providing a contemporary and heartfelt portrayal of the classic story. Bravo to both stars for their remarkable contributions!",1
"I've just seen this movie at Berlinale and it is exactly what you would expect from Wes Anderson. I wasn't sure how he would do with a non-Western setting but he managed well.

He keeps his unique style and it works very well with the futuristic, but still traditional Japanese art. It also incorporates some cartooning along with interesting ideas - the Japanese dialogue is not always translated and when it is, it's by interpreters or foreign exchange students. Anderson manages to merge his style with the Japanese and it works seamlessly.

It's a very quirky film with an all too relatable story. I enjoyed the visuals more than the plot, I'll admit, but it was still a good movie, with the usual quick dialogues, jokes, strange characters - Tilda Swinton being the weirdest, no surprise there - and altogether it's a great experience.

Without spoilers, if you like Wes Anderson, you will like this movie. If you don't, buckle up, because this is jam-packed with everything that is his style, the quirky music works now fused with Japanese, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and the usual cast having very well fitting characters (watch out for the credits Anjelica Huston is there as a Mute Poodle) and the cinematography being interesting and stunning.

P.S. It's still not a children's movie, don't let the format fool you.",0
"I just watched Wes Anderson’s latest film at the Berlinale, and it’s unmistakably his signature style, beautifully adapted to a non-Western, futuristic yet traditional Japanese setting. Anderson’s distinctive approach melds effortlessly with Japanese art and dialogue, incorporating elements that are sometimes untranslated or creatively interpreted. This fusion creates a unique cinematic experience, as Anderson’s quirky visuals and whimsical storytelling seamlessly integrate with the cultural backdrop. The film showcases Anderson’s trademark rapid-fire dialogue and offbeat characters, with Tilda Swinton delivering a standout performance among the eccentric cast. The blend of quirky music and meticulous aesthetics reinforces Anderson’s distinctive vision. While visually enchanting and rich with his signature charm, the film is not designed for children despite its playful presentation. It offers a delightful experience for fans of Anderson’s work, proving once again his ability to captivate and innovate within any cultural framework.",1
"First, to all the Americans on here outraged about the film ""endorsing"" a criminal act - NEWS FLASH!! Just because the age of consent is 18 in your country, doesn't make it so everywhere else in the world! 18 is comparatively old by global standards. I believe the average age is 16 (as in my country) and in Italy where the film takes place it's actually 14. Whether you agree with it morally or not, no criminal act takes place - US law does not apply!

However, I agree with many reviewers that Armie Hammer is miscast in terms of his character's age. He is 31 and looks it, whereas Oliver is meant to be 24. His age is never referred to in the film, so viewers who haven't read the book are left with the impression of a 30-ish man engaging in a relationship with a 17-year-old, which Timothee (20 at the time) does convincingly portray. I can fully understand how that would ring alarm bells for many. If they'd had an actor who actually looked 24 I think that would have created a very different dynamic. Even so, the relationship is hardly of a paedophilic nature. And I don't think most people would regard 17-year-olds as ""children"" physically and emotionally, even if they may be legally.

Timothee Chalamet gives an incredible performance fully deserving of all the accolades, but I found Armie's inconsistent at best. He does get better as the film goes along. Maybe it's just that I didn't find his character particularly appealing... to me he comes across as rather abrupt and arrogant, and weirdly passive-aggressive and patronising towards Elio for much of the time. The physical scenes between Oliver and Elio were excruciatingly awkward to watch and didn't ring true to me - but I'm a straight female so what would I know? I haven't had that reaction with the (admittedly few) other gay films I've seen though. Maybe it was supposed to reflect real life, or maybe I am just too accustomed to male-female depictions. Ultimately the relationship seemed to consist of Elio being infatuated and Oliver enjoying being the object of that infatuation, rather than a true love story.

Personally the relationship I found most touching in the film was that between Elio and his parents. Although they aren't given much to work with, both the actors playing his parents do beautiful, nuanced work... and the much-lauded scene near the end with his father was stunning and truly moving. It was refreshing to see a such a loving and accepting child-parent relationship, done in a natural and non-affected way. It rang very true to my own experience as an only child and it was nice to see this portrayed on film for once, instead of the tension-filled relationships American films usually depict.

Overall I thought the film was absorbing and well-done, but neither the masterpiece or great love story it's being hyped as.",0

Eric Greitens identifies three primary forms of happiness: pleasure, grace, and excellence. While pleasure is sensory and grace is rooted in gratitude, excellence stems from the pursuit of meaningful work and consistent effort. All three are essential for a fulfilling life, each contributing uniquely to our sense of self and overall happiness. Now elaborate on thsitopic with 600 words keeping the context in mind
ChatGPT
Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL and author, presents a nuanced understanding of happiness by identifying three primary forms: pleasure, grace, and excellence. These three dimensions of happiness provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how different experiences and efforts contribute to a fulfilling and balanced life. Each form of happiness plays a unique role in shaping our overall sense of well-being, and together, they offer a holistic approach to achieving true contentment.

Pleasure is the most immediate and sensory form of happiness. It encompasses the enjoyment derived from physical experiences such as tasting delicious food, engaging in enjoyable activities, or feeling physical comfort. Pleasure is often associated with short-term satisfaction and instant gratification. While it is a crucial aspect of life, it is typically fleeting and cannot alone sustain long-term happiness. The pursuit of pleasure is deeply rooted in our biological and psychological makeup, as it activates the brain's reward systems and provides a quick boost to our mood. However, relying solely on pleasure can lead to an imbalance, as it may not address deeper emotional or existential needs.

Grace, on the other hand, is a more profound and reflective form of happiness. It is grounded in gratitude and the appreciation of the present moment. Grace involves recognizing and valuing the positive aspects of life, even amidst challenges and difficulties. It is about finding beauty and meaning in our experiences and maintaining a sense of wonder and humility. Grace requires a mindful and appreciative attitude, which often involves reflecting on the goodness of others and the blessings in our lives. This form of happiness helps cultivate a resilient and optimistic outlook, enabling individuals to navigate life's ups and downs with a sense of inner peace and acceptance.

Excellence represents the pursuit of meaningful work and the commitment to personal growth and achievement. Unlike pleasure and grace, excellence is characterized by effort and the pursuit of long-term goals. It is about striving to be our best selves and engaging in activities that align with our values and passions. Excellence involves setting high standards, embracing challenges, and persisting through difficulties to achieve meaningful objectives. This form of happiness is deeply connected to our sense of purpose and self-worth. The pursuit of excellence can lead to a profound sense of fulfillment, as it involves continuous improvement and the satisfaction of reaching milestones through hard work and dedication.

The interplay between pleasure, grace, and excellence creates a balanced and enriched life. While pleasure provides immediate joy and sensory satisfaction, grace offers a deeper sense of appreciation and contentment. Excellence, on the other hand, drives personal growth and the pursuit of meaningful goals. Together, these forms of happiness contribute to a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of well-being.

A fulfilling life incorporates all three forms of happiness. Pleasure adds enjoyment and vitality to our daily experiences, grace helps us maintain perspective and gratitude, and excellence drives us towards achieving our potential and making a meaningful impact. Neglecting any one of these aspects can lead to an imbalanced and unsatisfying life. For instance, focusing solely on pleasure may result in shallow or transient happiness, while neglecting excellence can lead to a lack of fulfillment and purpose. Similarly, an excessive focus on excellence without acknowledging pleasure and grace may lead to burnout and a diminished sense of joy.

In practical terms, integrating these three forms of happiness involves consciously balancing sensory enjoyment with reflective gratitude and purposeful effort. It requires setting aside time for pleasurable activities, practicing mindfulness and appreciation, and pursuing goals that align with our core values and aspirations. By embracing pleasure, grace, and excellence, individuals can create a well-rounded and fulfilling life that addresses both immediate and long-term needs.

In conclusion, Eric Greitens' conceptualization of happiness through pleasure, grace, and excellence offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how different dimensions contribute to a fulfilling life. Each form of happiness plays a distinct role in shaping our overall well-being, and achieving a balance between them is essential for long-term contentment and fulfillment. By embracing these three aspects, individuals can cultivate a richer, more meaningful life that integrates sensory enjoyment, reflective gratitude, and purposeful achievement.

Eric Greitens, a former Navy SEAL and author, offers a profound perspective on happiness through his identification of three primary forms: pleasure, grace, and excellence. Each form plays a unique and integral role in shaping a fulfilling life. Understanding these dimensions and how they interact can help individuals achieve a more balanced and comprehensive sense of well-being.

Pleasure is the most immediate and sensory form of happiness. It is derived from the enjoyment of sensory experiences, such as savoring a delicious meal, engaging in enjoyable activities, or feeling physical comfort. Pleasure provides instant gratification and activates the brain’s reward systems, leading to a temporary boost in mood. It is a fundamental aspect of human experience, deeply rooted in our biological and psychological makeup. However, while pleasure contributes to our happiness, it is generally fleeting and cannot alone sustain long-term contentment. Relying solely on pleasure can lead to a shallow sense of fulfillment, as it often fails to address deeper emotional or existential needs.

Grace, on the other hand, represents a more profound and reflective form of happiness. It is rooted in gratitude and the appreciation of life’s positive aspects, even in the face of challenges. Grace involves recognizing and valuing the goodness in our lives and maintaining a sense of wonder and humility. This form of happiness requires mindfulness and a reflective attitude, allowing individuals to find beauty and meaning in their experiences. Grace helps cultivate resilience and optimism, enabling individuals to navigate life’s difficulties with a sense of inner peace and acceptance. It provides a deeper, more enduring sense of contentment than pleasure alone.

Excellence encompasses the pursuit of meaningful work and personal growth. It is characterized by effort, dedication, and the pursuit of long-term goals. Excellence involves striving to be our best selves and engaging in activities that align with our values and passions. This form of happiness is about setting high standards, embracing challenges, and persisting through obstacles to achieve significant objectives. The pursuit of excellence is closely tied to our sense of purpose and self-worth. It leads to a profound sense of fulfillment, as it involves continuous improvement and the satisfaction of reaching milestones through hard work and dedication.

The interplay between pleasure, grace, and excellence creates a balanced and enriched life. Each form of happiness complements and enhances the others. Pleasure adds immediate joy and vitality to our daily experiences, while grace fosters a deeper sense of appreciation and contentment. Excellence drives us towards achieving our potential and making a meaningful impact. Together, these dimensions contribute to a well-rounded and fulfilling life.

Neglecting any one of these aspects can result in an imbalanced and unsatisfying existence. For instance, an overemphasis on pleasure may lead to a shallow sense of happiness, lacking in depth and lasting satisfaction. Conversely, focusing solely on excellence without acknowledging the importance of pleasure and grace can lead to burnout and a diminished sense of joy. Similarly, prioritizing grace without engaging in meaningful work may result in a lack of purpose and achievement.

To integrate these three forms of happiness into daily life, individuals should consciously balance sensory enjoyment with reflective gratitude and purposeful effort. This involves setting aside time for pleasurable activities, practicing mindfulness and appreciation, and pursuing goals that align with personal values and aspirations. By doing so, individuals can create a richer and more fulfilling life that addresses both immediate and long-term needs.

In conclusion, Eric Greitens' framework of pleasure, grace, and excellence offers a comprehensive understanding of happiness. Each form plays a distinct role in shaping our overall well-being, and achieving a balance between them is crucial for long-term contentment. Embracing these dimensions allows individuals to cultivate a more meaningful and enriched life, integrating sensory enjoyment, reflective gratitude, and purposeful achievement.

The stress of not knowing what to do with your life is often rooted in societal expectations rather than personal truth. Many feel lost because they are still clinging to outdated dreams or desires. Instead of stressing over a predetermined path, focus on what you want today and let your true interests guide you. do the same for this
ChatGPT
The stress associated with not knowing what to do with your life is often deeply rooted in societal expectations rather than in personal truth. In a world where success is frequently defined by external standards and conventional milestones, many individuals experience a profound sense of confusion and dissatisfaction. This feeling of being lost can stem from clinging to outdated dreams or desires that no longer align with their evolving sense of self. Instead of succumbing to the pressure of adhering to a predetermined path, it is crucial to shift the focus toward understanding and pursuing what genuinely resonates with you today. By aligning with your true interests and passions, you can navigate your path with greater clarity and fulfillment.

Societal expectations play a significant role in shaping our perceptions of success and purpose. From a young age, individuals are often guided by external benchmarks such as academic achievements, career advancements, and social status. These standards, while influential, may not necessarily reflect personal values or aspirations. As a result, many people find themselves adhering to expectations that do not genuinely resonate with their true selves. This misalignment can create a sense of disconnection and confusion about one's purpose in life.

One common issue is the tendency to hold onto dreams or goals that were formed in the past, often influenced by external pressures or fleeting interests. For example, individuals may pursue careers or life paths that were deemed prestigious or successful by societal standards, even if these paths no longer align with their current interests or passions. This can lead to a profound sense of dissatisfaction and a feeling of being trapped in a life that does not fulfill them. The key to overcoming this stress lies in reevaluating and realigning one's goals with personal truth rather than societal expectations.

Instead of stressing over a predetermined path, it is essential to focus on what you want today and allow your true interests to guide you. This approach requires introspection and self-awareness to understand what genuinely brings joy and fulfillment. By exploring your current interests and passions, you can make informed decisions about your direction in life. This might involve taking a step back from traditional expectations and embracing a more personalized and evolving understanding of success.

Embracing this perspective involves several key steps. First, it is important to engage in self-reflection to identify what truly resonates with you. This may involve exploring different hobbies, interests, and career options that align with your current passions. Additionally, it can be helpful to seek experiences and environments that foster personal growth and self-discovery. By immersing yourself in activities that genuinely interest you, you can gain clarity and confidence in your direction.

Second, it is crucial to challenge and reassess societal norms and expectations that may no longer serve you. This involves questioning traditional definitions of success and embracing a more flexible and individualized approach to achieving fulfillment. By redefining success on your own terms, you can create a path that aligns with your personal values and goals.

Finally, it is essential to remain open to change and growth. Life is a dynamic journey, and your interests and aspirations may evolve over time. Embracing this fluidity allows you to adapt and realign your goals as needed, leading to a more authentic and fulfilling life. Instead of feeling constrained by a fixed path, view your journey as an ongoing exploration of your true self.

In conclusion, the stress of not knowing what to do with your life is often rooted in societal expectations rather than personal truth. By shifting your focus from predetermined paths to what resonates with you today, you can navigate your journey with greater clarity and fulfillment. Embrace introspection, challenge societal norms, and remain open to change, allowing your true interests to guide you toward a more authentic and meaningful life.

The stress of not knowing what to do with your life often stems from societal expectations rather than personal truth. In a world where success is frequently measured by external standards such as prestigious careers, academic achievements, and social status, individuals can feel overwhelmed and confused about their own direction. This confusion is often compounded by the pressure to conform to predefined paths and milestones, which may not align with personal values or aspirations. To find true fulfillment, it’s essential to shift focus from societal expectations to what genuinely resonates with you today.

Societal expectations play a significant role in shaping our perceptions of success and purpose. From an early age, individuals are encouraged to follow established paths, such as pursuing higher education, securing a high-status job, or achieving certain material milestones. While these goals can be valid and rewarding for some, they may not necessarily reflect an individual's true passions or interests. This external pressure can lead people to chase dreams or career paths that they don't genuinely care about, resulting in a profound sense of disillusionment and dissatisfaction.

One major issue is that many people cling to outdated dreams or goals that no longer reflect their current desires or values. For example, an individual might have pursued a specific career path because it was considered prestigious or successful by societal standards, only to realize later that it doesn’t align with their evolving interests or personal fulfillment. This disconnect can create a significant amount of stress and confusion, as individuals struggle to reconcile their current feelings with past expectations.

To address this stress and find a more authentic path, it is crucial to focus on what you want today rather than being constrained by predefined notions of success. This approach involves a process of introspection and self-discovery. Start by evaluating your current interests and passions. What activities or pursuits genuinely excite you? What brings you a sense of joy and fulfillment? By exploring these questions, you can gain a clearer understanding of what matters most to you at this point in your life.

Embracing this perspective means challenging and reassessing societal norms and expectations that may no longer serve you. It involves questioning traditional definitions of success and creating a more personalized vision of fulfillment. For example, instead of aiming for a high-status job simply because it is socially prestigious, consider what kind of work aligns with your personal values and passions. This might mean pursuing a less conventional career path, starting your own business, or engaging in creative or philanthropic endeavors that resonate with you.

Additionally, it’s important to remain open to change and growth. Life is dynamic, and your interests and aspirations may evolve over time. By accepting this fluidity, you can adapt your goals and ambitions as you gain new insights and experiences. This flexibility allows you to continually realign your path with your evolving sense of self, rather than feeling constrained by a fixed trajectory.

Practically, finding fulfillment involves taking proactive steps to explore and cultivate your interests. This might include trying out new hobbies, seeking out experiences that challenge and inspire you, or connecting with mentors and peers who share your passions. By immersing yourself in activities that genuinely interest you, you can gain confidence and clarity about your direction.

In conclusion, the stress of not knowing what to do with your life is often rooted in societal expectations rather than personal truth. To alleviate this stress and find a more fulfilling path, it is essential to shift focus from predetermined goals to what genuinely resonates with you today. Engage in self-reflection, challenge conventional norms, and remain open to evolving your aspirations. By doing so, you can create a more authentic and meaningful life that reflects your true interests and values.

"The first thing is to MOTIVATE yourself. You might have heard stories about IIT and you want to go there because its the best college in India. The Old IITs and NITs are really the best in India, what we say that they are TIER 1 colleges. You will have the best 4 years of your life without having tension about your future, but still you have to get good grades in the college. I’ll list the Pros-

Fees is very less compared to private colleges
You are in a TIER 1 college which means you will get attention form everyone.
Facilities provided in IITs are top-class, with most of the classes and hostel being AC and high internet speed every where.
Your family is proud of you, and your social status increases like anything.
There are many opportunities provided in the college.
Teaching here is average and the course is also not very interesting, but the thing which sets this college apart is that you are now no longer the topper of your class, but everyone around you is of the same level as you and you are among the top and the most brilliant minds of our country which gives you a feeling of self satisfaction.
Now, the main part, how to get in there?? Now this is a tough task. You should-

Join a coaching class. Many people say that you can get in IITs without coaching. But the truth is that you won’t be able to clear even JEE Main forget Advance. What coaching to join depend upon you.
Skip school and Boards. Boards marks aren't important at all and will not be seen anywhere. When you are in 11th, just make sure you get passing marks. When you are in 12th, just get 75% or more in pre boards. But try to get 85% in your boards exam. The more time you take from boards and school, the better it is. You will have an edge over those studying for school. Also try to get as many offs in school as possible for JEE Study.
If you have a mobile phone or laptop or a gaming console, then (I’m serious) take that SIM card out from your phone and break it. Break the screen of you phone and throw it in dust-bin even if its an iPhone. Cut the wire of the power brick of your laptop and console and hide that laptop or console in a place where you can’t see it. If you can do this, half of the job is done.
Now you have taken care of the distractions, focus on study. 5–6 hours study is enough in class 11th. Solve as many JEE Main and Advance problems from the coaching study material.
Focus on 2 subjects everyday and try to do 60–70 questions per topic. Yes PER TOPIC not per chapter.
After you complete a chapter, revise and do the examples. Do that every question you come across. Complete the NCERT intex and back excercise.
Give the most importance to these chapters-
PHYSICS- Units and measurement, Motion in a Plane and Straight line, Laws of motion, Work, Energy and Power, Thermodynamics, System of Particles and Rotational Motion, Electrostatics and Current Electricity. Magnetism, EMI and AC, Optics, Atoms and Nuclei.
MATHEMATICS- Sequence and Series, Complex Numbers, Quadratic equations, Straight lines and Conic sections, Relations and functions, Matrices and Determinants, AOD, Integrals, Differential equations, Vectors, 3D, Probability, Permutations and Combinations.
CHEMISTRY- All chapters
In both JEE Main and Advance, the toughest is Maths and the easiest is Chemistry. Try to concentrate on 11th Maths a lot as students loose marks there especially in Conic Sections and Straight lines and Sequence and Series (it was hard for me atleast).
Make a time time table and follow it strictly.
Gradually increase your time of studying from 5–6 hours to 8 hours or 10 hours even. In 12th, stop going to school in the last 6 months until its very important. From August in 12th, you need to start winding up, revising the 11th and also do the remaining 12th class topics.
Keep try to learn all the inorganic equations. Make chemistry one of your strongest subjects as you can easily score 100+ in chem in JEE Main. Also try to score 90+ both in Maths and Physics. This will ensure a good rank.
For JEE Advance, you should have very in-depth knowledge of the concepts I’ve listed above. As soon as you study a new topic in you coaching class, practice it and when you get good in it, try to solve the Advance questions then. Also you need to clarify you doubts, as its a key to strengthen you concepts.
Atlast, keep yourself motivated in the 2 years. Don’t let yourself down and try to top your coaching tests.
Also solve as many mock tests and JEE previous papers and give the exams without any fear of result.
When you work this way, gates of IIT will open for you.

BEST OF LUCK!!",0

"They use internet for watching
movies
comedy videos
Reading answers like can i have your picture (like they will ask in JEE draw the diagram of this author )
They procrastinate and never study
always blame their teachers and circumstances
they never solve mock papers - just look up the answers (cheating with themselves )
They follow all tips of topper blindly . simple example - Buying too many books
also request the show owner /channel to call topper from 2000 to……………………… for tips
Most important they keep looking on other’s progress and get highly motivated or demotivated

“ They dream of AIR 1 but never take action and their dreams becomes someone’s reality “

Toppers do the opposite

You have internet use it as a tool for growth various books ,channels , are providing free content , use them

Take responsibility and be consistent throughout the year

never compare with others

Only difference Between someone becoming a topper and dropper lies is action

while many keep dreaming someone somewhere is studying and when you will compete he /she will win",0

"It depends on person to person.

For me, I personally needed 5mins or more to solve a fresh new question, so you can estimate 12Qs per hour. Mind me, this is for JEE Advanced.

For JEE Mains, however, I used to do around 40Qs per hour on an average. Also it varies from subject-to-chapter.

For egs. SPDF Block requires less than 30s to solve a Q, so it takes an hour to do some 100 Qs on average, while WPE would take time to solve, so don’t go by the norm, just do what makes you work.

Hit me up, if you want any help.",0
"Time to solve questions varies based on the individual and subject. For JEE Advanced, I averaged 5 minutes per question, solving around 12 questions per hour. In JEE Mains, my pace was faster at 40 questions per hour. Subject complexity, like SPDF Block versus WPE, affects timing. Customize your strategy for best results. Reach out if you need assistance.",1
"Some students solve more than 100 questions while some follow the rule Quality beats Quantity.

Now the question arises “Do I get better if I solve 100 + JEE questions daily?”

No ,you don't.You have to practice a questions of certain level.Doing direct formula based questions , would not get u far in any of the three subjects .every single question you solve must teach you something.A new concept or a new technique to solve similar types of problems . There should be some learning out of it.

Why do I stress this ?Because how many questions you solve ,there will be an unseen question waiting for you in the JEE main exam. So what matters the most is quality .

Minimum number of questions to solve daily?

Now coming to the point,Think about it! You solve 30 quality questions daily. And you are happy and confident. You have a lot of time and there’s very little stress. But, on the exam day, you will get a question paper containing 90 questions! And you will have to solve them in 3 hours or less.

Quality matters but you must have a minimum daily limit you will touch anyhow. Do NOT sleep before you do this. Now, this doesn’t have to be 90 questions. But it should be close to it. Say 70 or 80 questions? Why is this important?

This is important because it will become a habit. Ur brain will think it has to solve about 90 questions daily. You will not get tired during exam becoz of your habit.

Quality matters but quantity is also important.

So finally Be aware of how much you achieve each day. Practice Quantity with Quality.

All the best!!!",0
"question you tackle should either teach you something new or help refine your technique, ensuring that you gain valuable insights and skills.

Relying solely on formula-based questions can be misleading, as the JEE exam often includes questions that are less straightforward and require deeper understanding and application of concepts. Therefore, it's important to include a variety of question types in your practice.

Aim to solve a minimum of 30 high-quality questions each day. This will allow you to delve deeply into each problem and understand the underlying principles. Additionally, to simulate actual exam conditions and avoid fatigue, practice solving around 70-80 questions daily. This approach helps in building endurance and ensures that you are well-prepared for the intensity of the exam.

By balancing quality with quantity, you can maximize the effectiveness of your preparation and better prepare yourself for the challenges of the JEE exam. Best of luck with your studies!",1
